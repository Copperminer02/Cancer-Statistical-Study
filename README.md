## ML Mockup and Data Flow
3.	Explore Data:
a.	Descriptive Statistics: Count, Mean, Std, min, 25%, median, 75%, max
4.	Plot Data:
a.	Histograms
5.	Create a Training and Test Set of Data
a.	70:30 split, 80:20 split, 90:10 split
b.	Determine which split works best for the data.
6.	Model Classification:
a.	Build classification models to evaluate performance on the training data
b.	ML Models: random forest, decision trees, logistic regression, random forest, k-means clustering, support vector mechanisms, PCA
c.	These machine learning algorithms were chosen because of they are robust to outliers and non-linear data, run efficiently on large data sets, robust against overfitting and consistent with the ML algorithms used in biomedical research.
