## ML Mockup and Data Flow
1.	Explore Clean Data:
     a. Descriptive Statistics: Count, Mean, Std, min, 25%, median, 75%, max
2.	Plot Data:
      a.Histograms to check normality and distribution
3.	Create a Training and Test Set of Data
      a. 70:30 split, 80:20 split, 90:10 split
      b. Determine which split works best for the data. Models evaluated based on accuracy, recall, F1 score and precision. 
      c. The F1 score will be used to measure the model’s accuracy and it’s a mean of precision and recall. F1 scores closer to 1 indicate lower false    positives and lower false negatives The recall score measures the extent to which the model can correctly identify true positives. The accuracy score is the relationship between the number of correct predictions and total number of predictions. The precision score represents the relationship between the true positives and all positives. 
      d. Determine optimal number of features to be included.
4. 	Model Classification:
    a. Build classification models to evaluate performance on the training data
    b. Supervised ML Models: random forest, decision trees, logistic regression, random forest, support vector mechanisms.
    c. Unsupervised ML Models: clustering, PCA
    c. These machine learning algorithms were chosen because of they are robust to outliers and non-linear data, run efficiently on large data sets, robust  against overfitting and consistent with the ML algorithms used in biomedical research.
